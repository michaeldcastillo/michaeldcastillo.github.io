Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer, Web Developer

I strive to bridge the gap between business and technology. Unlike many conventional information technology pros, I only find technology interesting when it solves business problems and serves the needs of real people. As such, user experience provides the context for how I think about every product or service created and consumed.

Most recently, I have spent a 10 years of my career learning and working with Microsoft SharePoint and related technologies (now Office 365) to facilitate team collaboration and communication in the workplace. Prior to that, I have spent many additional years working as a designer for print and digital media (branding, user interface, audio/video/animation, etcetera). Currently, I am focused on learning and improving my skills with full-stack JavaScript development.
